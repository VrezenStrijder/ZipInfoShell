# ZipInfoShell
  A tiny windows shell extension app.  
  When I need to extract a compressed file on Windows, I often have to open it first to see if the outermost layer is a single directory or contains multiple files. If it's a single directory, I can extract it directly to the current location. Otherwise, I might need to create a new folder first and then extract the contents into it. This operation isn't complicated, but it often wastes a lot of my time. That's why I created this tool that allows me to right-click on a compressed file and immediately see the file structure information of the outermost layer, as well as get a recommended extraction method. This is very useful for me, and I hope you'll like it too.
